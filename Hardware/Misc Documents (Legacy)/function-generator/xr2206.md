Transistor: Q2878:



Muting is traditionally done with a JFET

"Jfets are used as you don't have the base-emitter junction. If you don't know how jfets work - time to hit Google and get the basics. Last time i used one was 25years ago, so I'm rusty on the finer points. From what i recall, the device is on with no gate bias. Apply bias to the gate to turn it off. Voltage vs current in relation to a bjt."

"A simple J-FET switch is easy to accomplish. The use of a P-channel J-FET is required. The more common N-channel will not give the same results, especially fading. A common device is the 2N5462 or the J176 or J177 available from Jameco (part number 140142CF $.59ea or 211414CF $.29ea at 2005 prices)."

"For bipolar AC audio signals, your best choice would be a "transmission gate" chip such as CD4016 or CD4066, or an analog multiplexer chip, which is an array of such gates with a common connection.

These devices have the most symmetrical characteristics, minimizing distortion of audio signals.

Internally, they are a pair of back-to-back MOSFETs driven by complementary control signals."
