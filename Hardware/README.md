The control system consists of embedded measurements and actuation managed by two Arduino UNO controllers. A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to coordinate the microntrollers and pheripheral instruments. The Master Arduino Manages actuation of applied voltage, frequency, duty cycle and gas flow rates via homebrewed circutiry. (See \hardware section for details on instruments and ciruit diagrams). The Master Arduino also measures RMS applied voltage and RMS current via AC-to-RMS converter circuits as well as total light intensity via a photodarlington. The x,y and z position of the jet is coordinate by the Complementry Arduino equipped with two Adafruit Motor Control Shields. See the diagram below for information flow relating to the Arduino UNOs.
